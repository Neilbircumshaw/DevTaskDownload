## Task Instructions

In this simple, unfinished web page, you’ll find a number of mistakes and some unfinished code.  Currently no PHP is used, but if you feel comfortable, you can convert the index file to php and use PHP where appropriate.  

Your task is to:

- Fix any errors or mistakes that you find
- Retrieve and format some json data from the db.json file
- Finish styling and adding content to the page to match the included design (homepage.jpg / homepage.psd)
- Make a note of anything that you come across that you might consider ‘bad practice’ or that you would just do differently

#### Rules

- You can use any online resources or documentation that you need - please keep your browser history during the task so we can see the pages you’ve visited
- No css bootstrap please
- You are welcome to use css or scss, whichever you feel most comfortable with.  
- If you’re using scss, you can either use the provided gulpfile and package.json, or replace these with whatever compiling method you prefer.
- You can use jQuery or vanilla javaScript, whichever you prefer
- If you’ve got any questions or you get stuck, ask us for help!
